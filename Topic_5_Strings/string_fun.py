# let's explore strings in Python

# Strings are sequences of characters
# Strings are immutable
# Strings can be indexed and sliced

# Strings can be created using single quotes
food = 'kartupelis'
print(food)

# Strings can be created using double quotes
drink = "coffee"
print(f"I like to drink {drink}")

# in Python there is no difference between single and double quotes

# Why is it useful to have both single and double quotes?
# If you want to use a quote inside a string

quote = "He said, 'I am hungry'" # note the use of double quotes
print(quote)

# otherwise I would have to use escape characters
quote = 'He said, \'I am hungry\''
print(quote)

# list escape characters
# \n - newline
# \t - tab
# \\ - backslash
# \' - single quote
# \" - double quote
# there are a few others

# let's make a string with some newlines
s = "Hello\nWorld"
print(s)

# for longer strings, we can use triple quotes
# this is useful for docstrings and other multi-line strings
long_string = """This is a long string
that spans multiple lines
    and uses triple quotes      
    Can use single or double quotes inside this string
for example 'single quotes' or "double quotes"
only thing we can not use is triple quotes :)

# f-strings allow us to embed expressions inside strings

# how about getting more than one letter?
# in Python we can use slicing

# let's get first 3 letters
# slicing full syntax is [start:stop:step]
# we can omit start, stop or step
# if we omit start, it is 0
# if we omit stop, it is end of the string
# if we omit step, it is 1

# so let's get first 3 letters
first_three = food[:3] # same as food[0:3]

# we can use step
# first let's get our english alphabet

# note that strings are immutable
# so if we want to change a string we have to create a new one
# we can concatenate strings
# we can use + operator
# we can use += operator to update the string
# we can use join method
# we can use f-strings

# existance check in strings
# we can use in keyword

# we can also use help(str) to see all available methods
# full docs on string methods https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#string-methods

# useful method is replace
