# let's explore strings in Python

# Strings are sequences of characters
# Strings are immutable
# Strings can be indexed and sliced

# Strings can be created using single quotes
food = 'pizza'
print(food)

# Strings can be created using double quotes
drink = "coffee"
print(f"I like to drink {drink}")

# in Python there is no difference between single and double quotes
