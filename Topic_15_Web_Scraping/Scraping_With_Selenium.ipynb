    "# Web Scraping and Automation with Selenium\n",
    "\n",
    "Selenium is a powerful tool for controlling web browsers through programs and performing browser automation. It is functional for all browsers, works on all major OS and its scripts are written in various languages i.e Python, Java, C#, etc. Selenium can be installed via the Python package manager pip.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike Beautiful Soup, Selenium requires a web driver to interface with the chosen browser. Web drivers is a package to interact with a web browser. It interacts with the web browser or a remote web server through a wire protocol which is common to all. You can check out and install the web drivers of your choice.\n",
    "\n",
    "Selenium will be slower but will work essentially on all pages because it is a browser. It will render the JavaScript on the page and scrape the data after it has fully loaded.\n",
