# Python Tuples (a, b, c, d, e) - Latviski - korteži, nemaināmi saraksti
# some properties of tuples
# Immutable - we don't change the values of a tuple itself
# Usage - pass data around, return multiple values from a function
# Tuples are faster than lists
# Tuples are used as dictionary keys - tuples are generally hashable
# Tuples uses for packing and unpacking
# Tuples are indexed, ordered, and iterable
# Tuples have their own methods, but fewer than lists
# Tuples can be nested just like lists
# Philosophically - Tuples are for heterogeneous data (different data types)
#  lists are best for homogeneous data - same type of data
# Python lets us use either for either, but it's a good practice to use them as intended
