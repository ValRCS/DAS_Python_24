# our first program - our first comment
# in Python we use # for comments
# comments are for humans, computers ignore comments
# print("Sveiciens pavasarim!")
# print('Sveiciens saulei 🌞') # Python has full Unicode support built in

# best comments are those that answer WHY questions
# when learning we can also write plenty of WHAT
print("This is a normal thumbs up 👍") # WHAT would be saying this is print - kind of useless

print("This is finally ok 👌")
# all built in functions are defined here
# https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html

print(2+2)
print(10+3*7) # normal arithmetic rules are followed
print(70-8)
# a little bit different with division
print(20/7) # so / is division that gives you floating point number
print(20//7) # gives the integer part of result
# reminder / modulo - not quite the same
print(20%7)
print(20%2)
print(21%2) # reminder often used in determing odd or even
# powers are built in with **
print(2**8) # so 8 bits give you 256 possible values
# 16-bit addressing
print(2**16)
# 32-bit adreses
print(2**32)
# 64-bit adreses
print(2**64)
# Python offers _ as syntax sugar to enter big number
print(1_000_000) # _ is ignored
# big numbers
# built in support for big numbers
print(10**100)
# so Googol - funnily named after Google which was a comic hero? in 1920s
# https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Googol

# i can use ** for roots as wel
print(9**0.5)

print("Beer "+"Mug") # string concatenation
print("Beer","Mug") # , by default is one space
print("One",2,"Three","🚀") # so 4 differnt things are printed
# print("One" + 2) # not permitted two different data types
# print("2" + 2) # similarly not allowed
print("2" + str(2))
print(int("2") + 2)

# however Python lets you multiple string with number
print("Beer 🍺 " * 5)
# useful for example
print("*"*40)
# I will write some more un ceru ka skāna
