# What is a File?
# A file is a named location on disk to store related information. 
# It is used to permanently store data in a non-volatile memory (e.g. hard disk).
# Idea of persistent storage that outlives the execution of a program.
# files have multiple formats: text, binary, etc.
# text files we define the encoding (e.g. UTF-8, ASCII, etc.)
# binary files are not human readable
# text files can have multiple formats: TXT, CSV, JSON, XML, HTML, PY, etc.
# typically these days we deal with Unicode text files encoded in UTF-8
