# information hiding is the principle of hiding the internal state and requiring all interaction to be performed through an object's methods

# let's make a person whose address will be semi -hidden
# and phone number will be hidden

class Person:

        self.name = name
        self._address = address # _ means that this is a semi-hidden attribute

    def print_phone(self):
        # here we could check if we are authorized to print the phone number
        print(self.__phone)

    # then all manipulation with phone number should be done through methods
    # here is a classically named setter method
    def set_phone(self, phone):
        # here we could validate the phone number
        # is it 8 digits long?
        # is it only numbers?

        return self.__phone
    
# let's make a person

# let's print address
person.print_address()
# we could print directly...

# now how about phone?
person.print_phone()
# how about directly
try:
