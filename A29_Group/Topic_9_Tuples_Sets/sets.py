# Sets - Kopas Latviski
# Sets are unordered collections of unique elements. 
# We can construct them by using the set() function.
# Set properties:
# Sets are unordered - ! no indexing !
# Sets do not allow duplicates - all items are unique
# Sets are mutable - we can add and remove items

# Usage of sets
# - remove duplicates from a lists, tuples, etc
# - check for membership - quicker than lists or tuples for large collections
# - set operations - union, intersection, difference, etc
