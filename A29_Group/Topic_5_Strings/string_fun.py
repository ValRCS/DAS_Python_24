# let's talk about strings in Python

# Strings are a sequence of characters 
# Python actually does not have a character data type, a single character is a string of length 1
# Strings are immutable, meaning you cannot change them in place
# Strings can be indexed and sliced

# Strings can be created with single, double or triple quotes
